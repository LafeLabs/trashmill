# Trash Mill

Trash Mill is the beginning of a new industrial civilization built only from trash and the Sun.

We begin by producing clothes, accessories and jewelry from a mixed waste stream of discarded cloth scrap, cardboard, and plastic bottles.  All things we make advertise this new way of existing, which will self-replicate as demand stimulates free replication.

Trash Mill is based on the use of direct solar energy(not photovoltaics).  The Sun is concentrated over an area a few meters on a side into an area smaller than a meter which has a heat absorber and steam boiler which drives a steam engine.  The steam is sent through heat exchangers for use in heat-working of plastics, then condensed into a retort which collects the distilled water for later use.  The rotation of the steam engine drives a water pump which keeps moving water from a dirty source through the system to the clean water reservoir.   

Rotation of the steam engine also drives a flywheel which is coupled to pulleys which drives belts which drive other pulleys for direct mechanical drive of arbitrary machines.  Machines which are built to run on this include sewing machines for making clothes, vacuum pumps for pumping on water for active cooling as well as industrial processes, machine tools for working metal, electric generators for running all kinds of electrical machines, and all the parts of the textile factory. 

The elements that make up the textile factory are a slicer which turns bottles into long strips of plastic, an extruder which draws the strips out into filaments, a spinner which spins that into thread, a loom which weaves into cloth, and a sewing machine to finish the clothes.  HVAC will be built into the system to make it comfortable in the shop where the work is being done.  

Target power for the whole system is between 1 and 20 kW.  If we assume an efficiency of on the order of 25%, this means we need between 4 and 100 square meters, or between a 2 m X 2 m array and a 10 x 10 array.  Individual heliostats are built from Trash Robot elements, the same as the trash printer.
