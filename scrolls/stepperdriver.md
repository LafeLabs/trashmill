# DVD Trash Stepper Motor Controller

1. Buy USB  to SATA converter cable
2. get a DVD drive working with it on the Raspberry Pi or laptop
3. Hack it to do what we want, get direct control via Pi(just open and close drawer)
4. Use logic probe, scope, volt meter to find digital power, motor power, STEP, DIR, and EN pins
5. Document these in detail with photographs in the Trash Mill docs
6. Cut out part of circuit board with controller chip, build cable which mates to Arduino with headers to plug into Arduino headers, disconnect the reconnect board to motor which drives stage, connect to Arduino, test
7. Integrate control board with cable to Arduino into the mechanical enclosure for the stage in standard cardboard mechanicals
8. Repeat again and again, carefully document, make sure it can scale
