Trash Mill is the beginning of a new industrial civilization built only from trash and the Sun.

We begin by producing clothes, accessories and jewelry from a mixed waste stream of discarded cloth scrap, cardboard, and plastic bottles.  All things we make advertise this new way of existing, which will self-replicate as demand stimulates free replication.

Trash Mill is based on the use of direct solar energy(not photovoltaics).  The Sun is concentrated over an area a few meters on a side into an area smaller than a meter which has a heat absorber and steam boiler which drives a steam engine.  The steam is sent through heat exchangers for use in heat-working of plastics, then condensed into a retort which collects the distilled water for later use.  The rotation of the steam engine drives a water pump which keeps moving water from a dirty source through the system to the clean water reservoir.   

Rotation of the steam engine also drives a flywheel which is coupled to pulleys which drives belts which drive other pulleys for direct mechanical drive of arbitrary machines.  Machines which are built to run on this include sewing machines for making clothes, vacuum pumps for pumping on water for active cooling as well as industrial processes, machine tools for working metal, electric generators for running all kinds of electrical machines, and all the parts of the textile factory. 

The elements that make up the textile factory are a slicer which turns bottles into long strips of plastic, an extruder which draws the strips out into filaments, a spinner which spins that into thread, a loom which weaves into cloth, and a sewing machine to finish the clothes.  HVAC will be built into the system to make it comfortable in the shop where the work is being done.  

Target power for the whole system is between 1 and 20 kW.  If we assume an efficiency of on the order of 25%, this means we need between 4 and 100 square meters, or between a 2 m X 2 m array and a 10 x 10 array.  Individual heliostats are built from Trash Robot elements, the same as the trash printer.  

The end product is clothes with a *negative* water footprint, which produce clean distilled water as a byproduct of production, as well as *negative* carbon footprint, by taking waste away from landfills as well as use away from consumer factories.  If we build enough clothes for all humans, the consumer factories will all cease to exist.  All our fashion is body-specific.  Bodies of many people can be anonymously scanned into 3d files and used as models for fashion design in Blender made from triangles, which are then printed out as UV maps and cut and sewn with panels of cardboard or plastic trash as needed for function, fashion, and insulation.  All body types and styles can be arbitrarily designed for, with no difference in cost for how rare or common a design is.  Printing on plastic trash with Geometron printers can be used to create complex symbolic social media printed in and on all products, imparting complex information to people as we walk around wearing the clothes. 

## Major Elements of Trash Mill:

 - heliostats built from trash to build out into large array, target is 8" on a side square and we will want a couple hundred. these are crowd sourced, and run on an electrical generator
 - solar heat absorber built from trash, safe support tower for the system
 - steam boiler built from trash
 - steam engine built from salvaged gas engine(aim for 1 kW *output*, so a few kW input)
 - pumps scavenged from car parts driven by direct drive(water pump, vacuum pump)
 - tower structure for steam engine and absorber
 - Steam heat exchanger system with plastic molding and extrusion, welding irons
 - steam condenser and water collector and clean water tank
 - sewing machine built from trash
 - power transfer system(shafts, pulleys, belts, clutch mechanisms)
 - plastic bottle(PETE bodies) slicer/extruder to make filament
 - thread spinner to create plastic thread
 - loom to weave thread into cloth
 - 3d body scanner
 - fashion designer who can work in Blender with scanned body models and is familiar with using UV maps to export triangle grids for fabrication, create fully rendered images of what product will look like on body, and 3d printed models, and who can create high quality fashion for all body types and knows our processes and materials
 - a waste stream of cloth to be cut up and stitched into new clothes
 - a waste stream of cardboard to be used for thermal insulation and structure for clothes and accessories
 - a waste stream of plastic bottles, with bodies of bottles turning into thread for cloth and lids turning into printed media using the Geometron printer technology
 - site: plenty of dirty water, area for reflectors, safe place for absorber, work shop with built in HVAC to make it comfortable, all the tools and machines needed
 - Geometron self-replicating documentation to replicate the whole system
